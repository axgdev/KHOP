# KHOP
Kotlin Hierarchical Ordered Planner (KHOP). HTN planner written in Kotlin.

Largely inspired by [Pyhop planner](https://bitbucket.org/dananau/pyhop). This is a set of interfaces and abstract classes to generate domain knowledge in a type-safe manner, please see unit tests to see the basic usage of the planner.
